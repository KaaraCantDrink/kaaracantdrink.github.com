<h1>They Bet Me!</h1>
<p>"I won't drink for three months", said Kaara.</p>
<p>"I bet you twenty pounds you will", said Olu (from her work), confident it was a safe bet.</p>
<p>And so it began! A simple one sentance about how she'd save money to go home for christmas turned into one of the most lucritive investment opportunities (arguably) that  Kaara's friends will ever be faced with.</p>
<p>So far seven people have bet Kaara that between the dates of Monday 24th September and Friday 21st December 2012 she'll be unable to to hold out on her <b>no alchol</b> drinking vow.</p>
<h2>What are people saying?</h2>

  There's no chance of her doing that, she's a pisshead!

  I dunno if she know's what a soft drink is...

<h2>How the bet currently stands</h2>
<p>There are currently <b>6</b> people set to make <b>&pound;20</b> each when Kaara drinks alchol in the next three months!</p>
<p>The lucky folk are:
  	<ul>
      <li>Ola</li>
      <li>Simon</li>
      <li>Mark</li>
      <li>Rosie W</li>
      <li>Jago</li>
      <li>Rosie H</li>
      <li>Hayley</li>
      <li>Martha</li>
	</ul>
