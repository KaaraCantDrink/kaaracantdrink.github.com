<h1>They Bet Me!</h1>
<p>"I won't drink for three months", said Kaara.</p>
<p>"I bet you twenty pounds you will", said a girl in her office.</p>
<p>And so it began! A simple one sentance about how she'd save money to go home for christmas turned into one of the most lucritive investment opportunities (arguably) that  Kaara's friends will ever be faced with.</p>
<p>So far seven people have bet Kaara that between the dates of Monday 24th September and Friday 21st December 2012 she'll be unable to to hold out on her <b>no alchol</b> drinking vow.</p>
<h2>What are people saying?</h2>
<blockquote>There's no chance of her doing that, she's a pisshead!</blockquote>
