#[They Bet Me!](http://theybet.me)

They Bet Me is a website about a simple bet. A stupid bet none the less.

I'm Simon and my girlfriend is Kaara Shepard.

For those who don't know her, she's a partying machine! She's a party goer, a party organiser, a legendary party dancer and more importantly a damn solid party drinker. She loves her red wine, hammers her cocktails and beats the boys on the beer.

We're off on a holiday to New Zealand at Christmas. We both started saving a few months back, and since then I've made a fair bit progress. Kaara's finding it hard though. Being the social sandbag she is, she's been soaking up a summer of social downpour.

Sitting at her desk one day she was bragging about how she'd save the money she needed..

##I'll just stop drinking for three months

And so it began.

XXXX, who sits next to Kaara, laughed out at such a ludicrous statement, "not a chance". Not being one to back down, Kaara stood firm and things soon escalated. A few moments later hands had shaken and **the first bet was done!**

*"I bet you £20 you can't keep that up for three months!"*

As soon as I heard of the bet, I pushed a bit for more details and was told that the bet means she can't drink from Monday 24th September until Friday 21st December 2012. The whole aim of saving money through not drinking was lost on my by this point and I set about to make some money for myself.

I <del>bet</del> decided to **invest** in Kaara another £20 that she would be unable to stay alcohol free for the next three months. And i'm fairly confident that she'll payout in the next few weeks.

At that point the bet stood at £40, with myself and XXXX involved.

##The numbers soon grew

Word soon spread, and two days after I placed my bet another five people were involved. As of setting up this website there are seven of us doubting her self discipline.
